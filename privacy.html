        <h1>Think Then Play Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2026</p>

        <p>
          Think Then Play (“we,” “us,” or “our”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how
          we collect, use, store, and protect information when you use the Think Then Play website and
          mobile application (collectively, the “Service”).
        </p>

        <h2>Guest Access (No Account Required)</h2>
        <p>
          You can use parts of Think Then Play without creating an account (“Guest Mode”). In Guest Mode,
          you can browse and access features that do not require an account.
          Registration is only required for account-based features such as saving and syncing your content across devices,
          and accessing personalised account data.
        </p>

        <h2>1) Information We Collect</h2>
