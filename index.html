          Yes. You can save custom cognitive training screens and reload them at any time
          to replay the same setup or make adjustments as you progress.

      </div>

        <span class="acc-q">Is Think Then Play available on Android?</span>
      </button>
      <div class="acc-panel">
        <p>
          Not yet. Think Then Play is currently available on iOS.
          Android may be supported in the future depending on demand and development priorities.

        <span class="acc-q">Is there a limit to how many screens I can save?</span>
      </button>
      <div class="acc-panel">
        <p>
          You can save multiple training screens. Any limits depend on your current app
          version and plan, which may evolve over time.

        <span class="acc-q">Can coaches or trainers use this with teams or groups?</span>
      </button>
      <div class="acc-panel">
        <p>Absolutely. Coaches and trainers use Think Then Play:</p>
        <ul class="faq-bullets">
          <li><strong>During practices</strong></li>
          <li><strong>In small-group training stations</strong></li>

        </ul>
        <p>
          Custom screens make it easy to tailor cognitive training drills to different
          skill levels, goals, and environments.
        </p>

      <button class="acc-item" type="button">
        <span class="acc-plus">+</span>
        <span class="acc-q">Will this app help improve my performance?</span>
      </button>
      <div class="acc-panel">
        <p>
          Think Then Play focuses on training the <strong>mental side of performance</strong> —
          the cognitive skills that show up across sport, fitness, and everyday movement:
        </p>

        <ul class="faq-bullets">
          <li><strong>Faster reaction time</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Quicker decision-making</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Improved focus under pressure</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Better anticipation and pattern recognition</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The app doesn’t replace physical training — it <strong>enhances</strong> it.
          By training how your brain processes visual information and reacts to cues,
          you support faster and more confident responses in real-world situations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because the training is <strong>sport-agnostic</strong>, users apply it across
          hockey, basketball, football, soccer, combat sports, fitness, and rehabilitation
          environments.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="acc-item" type="button">
        <span class="acc-plus">+</span>
        <span class="acc-q">Is this app used for rehabilitation or clinical purposes?</span>
      </button>
      <div class="acc-panel">
        <p>
          Think Then Play is designed as a <strong>cognitive performance training tool</strong>,
          not a diagnostic or medical device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some users incorporate it alongside rehabilitation, vision training, or recovery
          routines to support visual–motor coordination, focus, and reaction-based exercises.
          Always follow guidance from qualified professionals when using any training tool
          in a clinical or recovery setting.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="acc-item" type="button">
        <span class="acc-plus">+</span>
        <span class="acc-q">Do I need special equipment to use the app?</span>
      </button>
      <div class="acc-panel">
        <p>
          No. All you need is your phone.
          Many cognitive training drills can be done anywhere using just the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some users choose to add simple equipment — such as cones, balls, pucks, or steps —
          but it’s completely optional. You can prop your phone on a tripod, suction mount,
          tape it to a wall, or have a partner hold it to get started.
